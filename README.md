1. Environment & Toolchain Setup
Prepare hardware

Raspberry Pi 400 with official power supply

microSD card (≥ 16 GB, Class 10)

HDMI cable + monitor

Install and configure Balena tools

Install the Balena CLI on your development machine.

Create or sign in to your Balena Cloud account.

Verify you can provision and SSH into a test device.

2. Repository Familiarization
Clone the repo

bash
Copy
Edit
git clone https://github.com/balena-io-experimental/browser.git
cd browser
Review key files

Dockerfile.template (service image and dependencies)

start.sh (entrypoint that launches Chromium in kiosk mode)

config.json or environment‐variable conventions (URL, flags)

3. Kiosk Configuration
Define your target URL

Either bake it into the service’s ENV BROWSER_URL or expose it as a device ­environment variable in Balena Cloud.

Chromium launch flags (in start.sh)

--kiosk

--no-first-run

--disable-infobars

--incognito (optional)

Network & IP

Assign a static IP (192.168.50.10) via DHCP reservation or in /etc/dhcpcd.conf in the container.

Ensure the Pi400 joins the correct SSID or Ethernet network on boot.

4. Build & Deployment
Local build test

Run balena local build --arch=arm64 . to verify the image builds.

Push to Balena Cloud

balena push <yourAppName>

Provision your Pi400

Download the Balena-flashed image and boot the device.

Confirm it comes online in Balena Cloud.

5. Validation & Troubleshooting
Boot verification

Watch device logs (balena logs <device-uuid>) to confirm Chromium starts and navigates to http://192.168.50.10.

Performance tuning

Enable GPU acceleration flags if needed (--use-gl=egl, --enable-features=VaapiVideoDecoder).

Disable unneeded services to minimize boot time.

Resilience

Add a watchdog in start.sh to restart Chromium on crash.

Persist cookies or localStorage only if required.

6. Documentation & Handoff
Update README.md

Document all steps: flashing, environment variables, flags, troubleshooting tips.

Runbook

Create a brief runbook covering common failures (network down, Chromium crash).

Future enhancements

Auto-update mechanism via Balena Supervisor updates.

Centralized logging or health-check dashboard.

By following this structure—Setup → Familiarization → Configuration → Build → Validation → Documentation—you ensure a repeatable, maintainable kiosk deployment. Let me know if you’d like to dive deeper on any particular phase or need samples of Docker/start.sh modifications.

# balena-browser-kiosk

A Balena-powered Chromium kiosk application for Raspberry Pi 400. On boot, the device will automatically launch Chromium in kiosk mode and navigate to `http://192.168.50.10`.

## Overview

This repository provides a Docker-based service that runs Chromium in kiosk mode on a Raspberry Pi 400. It leverages the [balena-io-experimental/browser](https://github.com/balena-io-experimental/browser) template, adapting it to:

- Boot the Pi 400 from microSD with BalenaOS  
- Launch Chromium in full-screen kiosk mode  
- Navigate automatically to `http://192.168.50.10` on each boot  

---

## Prerequisites

- **Hardware**  
  - Raspberry Pi 400 with official power supply  
  - microSD card (≥ 16 GB, Class 10 recommended)  
  - HDMI cable and HDMI-capable monitor  

- **Software**  
  - [Balena CLI](https://github.com/balena-io/balena-cli) (v13.0.0 or later)  
  - A Balena Cloud account (free tier is sufficient)  
  - Docker (for local builds)  

- **Network**  
  - A DHCP server that can assign or reserve the static IP `192.168.50.10`  
  - Wired Ethernet or Wi-Fi network accessible by the Pi 400  

---

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the repository**  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-org/balena-browser-kiosk.git
   cd balena-browser-kiosk
Log in to Balena

bash
Copy
Edit
balena login
Create a Balena application (if not already existing)

bash
Copy
Edit
balena app create browser-kiosk --type raspberrypi4-64
Configuration
Set the target URL
By default, the container will navigate to http://192.168.50.10. To change this, you may:

Edit the ENV BROWSER_URL in Dockerfile.template.

Or set the device environment variable in Balena Cloud:

bash
Copy
Edit
balena env add BROWSER_URL http://192.168.50.10 --application browser-kiosk
Adjust Chromium flags
The launch script (start.sh) includes sensible defaults:

bash
Copy
Edit
chromium-browser \
  --kiosk \
  --no-first-run \
  --disable-infobars \
  --incognito \
  "$BROWSER_URL"
You may append or remove flags as needed.

Static IP configuration
If you require a fixed IP without DHCP reservation, you may modify /etc/dhcpcd.conf in the container or provision via Balena Network settings.

Build & Deployment
Local build (optional)

bash
Copy
Edit
balena local build --arch=arm64 .
Push to Balena Cloud

bash
Copy
Edit
balena push browser-kiosk
Provision the device

Download the Balena-flashed image for your application from Balena Cloud.

Flash your microSD card (e.g., with Balena Etcher).

Insert into the Pi 400 and power on.

Monitor logs

bash
Copy
Edit
balena logs <device-uuid> --follow
Validation & Troubleshooting
Chromium fails to launch

Verify that start.sh has executable permissions.

Check for missing dependencies in the Dockerfile.

Tail the logs for errors: balena logs <device-uuid>.

Page does not load

Confirm network connectivity (ping 192.168.50.10).

Ensure that BROWSER_URL is correct and reachable.

Performance tuning

Enable GPU acceleration flags: --use-gl=egl and --enable-features=VaapiVideoDecoder.

Disable unneeded services to accelerate boot time.

Auto-restart on crash

A simple loop is included in start.sh to relaunch Chromium if it exits unexpectedly.

Customization
Feel free to extend this project:

Auto-update mechanism via Balena Supervisor.

Health-check endpoint to verify kiosk uptime.
